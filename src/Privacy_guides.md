    Hi

    I want to let you know I have not ordered from you because of your use of the invasive Google javascript code embedded into your login page. The issues with this are:

        It collects substantial information about me that can be used to profile and track my browsing not only on [your shop] but across all other sites. I am not comfortable allowing Google to do this and you have no right to force me to hand over this information to Google.

        For ad block and javascript blocker users such as myself (who are growing in number), all we get when logging in with Google code disabled is a reload of the page. There is no error message so less tech savvy users will just navigate off the site and buy elsewhere.

    I tried to log in 15 times and each time it would just reload the I refuse to let Google track and profile me online with their invasive code and block it on all websites.

    As a result, regretfully I have not ordered with [your shop] on this occasion. Please consider switching to a privacy-conscious CAPTCHA or an alternative.

    You can see how invasvive Google Captcha is here and just how much personal data it collects to identify/track me: https://complianz.io/google-recaptcha-and-the-gdpr-a-possible-conflict/

    More and more people are avoiding google, facebook et al. and without changing I suspect you will be losing out on more custom.

    Thanks.
