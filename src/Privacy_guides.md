- Template for play services
	```
	The latest version of app is not working anymore when there are no google play services and other google apps on device . 
	I have one honor phone with no play services (since USA has stopped google from providing them) and one samsung one. 
	On honor phone, the latest app stopped working after latest update. Huawei was banned from using any google services so i am guessing this app has dependency on play services .
	I am a privacy concious user, so I consider having play services or any other google app on my device a huge invasion of my privacy. I generally uninstall play services from my device (through adb, without root). I did the same with my samsung phone. But after the latest update, the app has stopped working and just redirects to browser to bhim app homepage.
	This app is used nationwide and is expected to work on any device without play services. The reason i chose this over gpay was because gpay had play services dependencies and this didn't.
	Please look into the matter ASAP.

- Email template to tell your favourite online shops to stop using Google Captcha
	- ```
	    Hi,
	    I want to let you know I have not ordered from you because of your use of the invasive Google javascript code embedded into your login page. The issues with this are:
	        It collects substantial information about me that can be used to profile and track my browsing not only on [your shop] but across all other sites. I am not comfortable allowing Google to do this and you have no right to force me to hand over this information to Google.

	        For ad block and javascript blocker users such as myself (who are growing in number), all we get when logging in with Google code disabled is a reload of the page. There is no error message so less tech savvy users will just navigate off the site and buy elsewhere.
	    I tried to log in 15 times and each time it would just reload the I refuse to let Google track and profile me online with their invasive code and block it on all websites.
	    As a result, regretfully I have not ordered with [your shop] on this occasion. Please consider switching to a privacy-conscious CAPTCHA or an alternative.
	    You can see how invasvive Google Captcha is here and just how much personal data it collects to identify/track me: https://complianz.io/google-recaptcha-and-the-gdpr-a-possible-conflict/
	    More and more people are avoiding google, facebook et al. and without changing I suspect you will be losing out on more custom.
	    Thanks.
	```
